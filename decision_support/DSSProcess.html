Decision Support System Documentation</h1>
<h2 class="western">1. Introduction</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Purpose:<br/>
The Decision Support
System (DSS) is designed to help users make informed decisions by
evaluating multiple alternatives against a set of factors. The system
uses pairwise comparison to assess the relative importance of factors
and the performance of alternatives in relation to those factors. The
ultimate goal is to produce a final ranking of alternatives based on
their weighted scores.<br/>
<br/>
Overview:<br/>
The DSS follows a
structured process where users input alternatives and factors,
perform relative comparisons, and then calculate scores based on
weighted sums. The system is designed to be flexible, allowing
customization of certain steps, such as final score normalization,
and ensuring error handling (e.g., division by zero) is managed
gracefully. Java is the recommended language for implementation, and
the initial version will feature a command-line interface, which can
later be extended to support a graphical or web-based interface.</p>
<h2 class="western">2. System Components</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Factors:<br/>
Factors are criteria
used to evaluate the alternatives. They are identified by textual
descriptions provided by the user (e.g., 'Cost,' 'Quality,' 'Time').
Factors also have associated numeric ranks, which reflect their
relative importance in decision-making.<br/>
<br/>
Input Format: The
format for identifying factors is left up to the product user. This
can be a descriptive string or an alphanumeric code.<br/>
Rank: The
product will determine the relative rank of each factor based on
pairwise comparisons provided by the
user.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatives:<br/>
Alternatives represent the
options available for decision-making. Each alternative is evaluated
against the factors, and a final score is calculated.<br/>
<br/>
Input
Format: The format for identifying alternatives is also flexible and
defined by the product user.<br/>
Final Score: The final score of
each alternative is determined through a weighted sum of its
performance in relation to each factor.</p>
<h2 class="western">3. Pairwise Comparison for Ranking</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Input:<br/>
The product user
provides pairwise comparisons of factors and alternatives. Instead of
only indicating which item is more important, the user assigns
relative values to show the comparative importance. These values
reflect the proportional difference between items.<br/>
<br/>
Factor
Comparison: The user compares factors by assigning a relative value
to each. For example, if Factor A is twice as important as Factor B,
Factor A might receive a value of 10 and Factor B a value of 5. If
Factor A is three times as important, the values could be 30 and 10,
respectively.<br/>
<br/>
Alternative Comparison: For each factor, the
user compares two alternatives and assigns relative values based on
their performance in relation to that factor. For instance, if
Alternative 1 performs three times better than Alternative 2 in a
certain factor, their values might be 30 and 10, respectively.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Processing:<br/>
The system
calculates the overall ranking of factors and alternatives based on
the relative values provided in the pairwise comparisons. Factor
rankings are independent of the alternative rankings within each
factor, allowing the user to treat these rankings separately.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Error Handling:<br/>
- Factor
Ranking: Since factor rankings are independent of alternative
rankings within factors, the system is configured so that no
conflicting information can arise in the factor rankings. However,
the system may allow incomplete rankings to give the product user
more flexibility in providing input.<br/>
- Incomplete Comparisons:
The system should prompt the user when pairwise comparisons are
missing, but incomplete information is acceptable if the user prefers
greater flexibility.</p>
<h2 class="western">4. Cross-Ranking Matrix (Conceptual)</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Purpose:<br/>
The conceptual
cross-ranking matrix represents the relative importance of each
alternative for each factor. It serves as an intermediate step in
calculating final scores but does not need to be explicitly
implemented as a matrix in the code.</p>
<h2 class="western">5. Normalization</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Step 1: Normalize the cross-rankings
within each factor by dividing the value of each cross-ranking by the
sum of all cross-rankings for that factor.<br/>
Step 2: Handle
division errors, such as division by zero, by identifying and
reporting them to the user without crashing the system.</p>
<h2 class="western">6. Weighted Sum Calculation</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Process:<br/>
Compute the weighted
sum for each alternative by multiplying the normalized cross-rankings
with the corresponding factor’s rank. The result is the weighted
sum for each alternative.</p>
<h2 class="western">7. Final Score Normalization</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Optional Normalization:<br/>
The
final score normalization step is not mandatory, but it should be the
default behavior. Product users can customize this step by
determining a constant, such as scaling scores to 100, or they may
choose to skip this step entirely.</p>
<h2 class="western">8. Error Handling</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Input Validation:<br/>
Validate user
input for consistency and completeness, especially in pairwise
comparisons. Ensure that all comparisons are accounted for and make
sense relative to each other.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Error Reporting:<br/>
Report any
identified errors, such as missing comparisons or division by zero,
to the user with clear messages, ensuring that the application does
not crash as a result.</p>
<h2 class="western">9. Architecture &amp; Implementation</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Programming Language:<br/>
Java is
the recommended language for this project, given its familiarity
among developers and suitability for implementing command-line and
graphical interfaces.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Command-Line Interface:<br/>
The
initial implementation should be a command-line interface, which can
later be extended to support a graphical or web-based interface.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Future Extensibility:<br/>
Consider
designing the system to allow for future upgrades and enhancements,
such as replacing the CLI with a GUI or web-based interface.</p>
<h2 class="western">10. Conclusion</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The Decision Support System (DSS)
aims to facilitate informed decision-making through structured input
and calculations. By allowing pairwise comparisons and weighted
scoring, the system provides a reliable method for evaluating
multiple alternatives based on a set of defined factors. The DSS is
designed to be flexible, customizable, and extensible, enabling
further development and user-specific adaptations.</p>
